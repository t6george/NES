# NES-Emulator

I am really excited to be building an emulator which will play many of my beloved childhood videogames!

This project is currently a WIP, but I look forward to wrapping it up soon. So far, I have implemented a cycle-accurate MOS6502 CPU, and I am working on the APU (Audio Processing Unit) and PPU (Picture Processing Unit, an early ancestor to graphics cards). 

I wish a "gl hf" upon myself.
